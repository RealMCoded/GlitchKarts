An archive of [GlitchKarts](https://glitchkarts.com/474c49544348204b41525453) (Project NMKart) that can run without an internet connection in your web browser.

**Due to Github file size limits, the main data file must be downloaded separately.** [Download it from here](https://github.com/RealMCoded/GlitchKarts/releases/download/DataFile/NMKART-HTML5-Shipping.data), and then place it in the data folder.

Runner based on a fork of Unreal Engine 4.27.2 with HTML5 ES3 (WebGL 2) platform - see https://github.com/SpeculativeCoder/UnrealEngine-HTML5-ES3 for more information.
